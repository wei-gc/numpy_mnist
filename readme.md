# The first homework of DATA620004 神经网络和深度学习

## The best results and hyperparameters:
| learning rate | regularization | hidden dimension | Test Acc |
|--|--|--|--|
|0.5 | 0.1 | 256 | 95.03%

## To use the codes
- `train.py`  is for training and save network's parameter;
- `sweep.py` is for finding the best hyperparameter;
- `test.py` is for loading the network's parameter and testing it's performance.
